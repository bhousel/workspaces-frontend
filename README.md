# TDEI Workspaces Frontend User Interface

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

### ⚠️ Reminder: you must set the tag of the environment you wish to deploy in this repo, then run the deploy workflow in workspaces-stack to deploy to dev, stage or prod.

## Dev Setup

```
# set these e.g. to the dev TDEI instance--note: any tokens you get from these hosts must match the environment for other components
# e.g. you can't use dev TDEI KeyCloak JWT tokens in stage or production environments. 
export VITE_TDEI_API_URL=https://api-dev.tdei.us/api/v1/
export VITE_TDEI_USER_API_URL=https://portal-api-dev.tdei.us/api/v1/

# use your local workspaces-backend instance--or set to the dev instance of this component if not running locally

# install deps (first time only)
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run ```npm run dev``` and nothing happens, check that you've set your "exports" as above. Undefined environment variables are not handled gracefully right now.
